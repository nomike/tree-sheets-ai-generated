I need a latex template for my document and have the following requirements:

- The document should be in A4 format.
- On the top left corner of the page should be a square with no or white background and a 1 mm black border.
- On the top of the page, at the sime height as the square, should be a row of images. These are stored as "a.png", "b.png", "c.png" and "d.png", all of which are 2x2cm in size.
- Bellow that, there should be a horizontally centered title reading "English Name".
- Bellow that, there should be a horizontally centered sub title reading "Botanical Name".
- Bellow that, there should be a horizontally centered large image (tree.png).
- Bellow that, there should be a justified text block, spanning the width of the page with one pararaph of lorem ipsum text.

A second identical page should be added below.
